# Introductions: Some Random Stuff

## Lecture: 
Introduction to randomness in creative coding and its role in simulations. Discuss the difference between pure randomness and controlled randomness (Perlin noise).

## Book Reference: 
Chapter 1: Randomness

## JS/OOP Concepts: 
Basic functions, random() in p5.js, manipulating position, color, and size.

## In-Class Exercise: 
Simple sketch using random values to move shapes in random directions.

## Activity: 
Introduce constraints to randomness to create controlled yet dynamic outcomes.

## Supplemental Material:
- 🚂 [Drawing Object Trails](https://youtu.be/vqE8DMfOajk)—this example uses an array of vectors to store the history of an object. (19 min)
- 🚂 [Horizontal Directional Drilling](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/172-directional-boring)—an example of a simulation of a drill that makes use of vectors to store position and direction.
- 🚂 [Snake Game](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/115-snake-game-redux)—a basic "snake" game using vectors for the snake body and food position.
- 🚂 [Ray Casting](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/145-ray-casting-2d)—basic ray casting engine that uses vectors for the "rays".

## Homework: 
Create a sketch with multiple walkers. Experiment with arrays and classes, and/or drawing tools.

Alternatively, apply perlin noise to a project conserning other than movement. How about color, sound, images, video. See which of your older projects could use this.
