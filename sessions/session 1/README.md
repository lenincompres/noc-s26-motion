# Introductions: Random Stuff

## Lecture: 
Introduction to randomness in creative coding and its role in simulations. Discuss the difference between pure randomness and controlled randomness (Perlin noise).

## Book Reference: 
- 📕 [Nature of Code Chapter 0](https://natureofcode.com/random)

## p5.js Review

If you feel you need a p5.js refresher, specifically around Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript (classes and objects), here are links to the ICM videos:

- [Full p5.js track](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/)
- [Starting with OOP in JavaScript](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/2-classes)

## JS/OOP Concepts: 
Basic functions, random() in p5.js, manipulating position, color, and size.

## In-Class Exercise: 
Simple sketch using random values to move shapes in random directions.

## Activity: 
Introduce constraints to randomness to create controlled yet dynamic outcomes.
