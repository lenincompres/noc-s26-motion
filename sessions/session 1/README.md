# Introductions: Random Stuff

## Lecture: 
Introduction to randomness in creative coding and its role in simulations. Discuss the difference between pure randomness and controlled randomness (Perlin noise).

## Book Reference: 
Chapter 1: Randomness

## JS/OOP Concepts: 
Basic functions, random() in p5.js, manipulating position, color, and size.

## In-Class Exercise: 
Simple sketch using random values to move shapes in random directions.

## Activity: 
Introduce constraints to randomness to create controlled yet dynamic outcomes.
