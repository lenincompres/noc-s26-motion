# Introductions: Some Random Stuff

## Lecture: 
Introduction to Perlin noise ( controlled randomness) and its advantages over pure randomness for creating more natural-looking motion and patterns. Compare random and noise-based movement. Using helper methods, and creating objects and Classes.

## Book Reference: 
- 📕 [Nature of Code Chapter 0 (...continued)](https://natureofcode.com/random)

## p5.js Review

If you feel you need a p5.js refresher, specifically around Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript (classes and objects), here are links to the ICM videos:

- [Full p5.js track](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/)
- [Starting with OOP in JavaScript](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/2-classes)

## JS/OOP Concepts: 
Basic functions, random() in p5.js, manipulating position, color, and size.

## In-Class Exercise: 
Simple sketch using random values to move shapes in random directions. Refactor the previous exercise to use Perlin noise, smoothing out the chaotic movements into more organic ones. Navigate a 3D array with perlin noise.

## Activity: 
Introduce constraints to randomness to create controlled yet dynamic outcomes.

## Homework: 
Create a sketch with multiple walkers. Experiment with arrays and classes, and/or drawing tools.

Alternatively, apply perlin noise to a project conserning and aspect other than movement—how about color, sound, images, video? See which of your older projects could use this.
