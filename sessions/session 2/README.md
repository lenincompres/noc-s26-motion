# Introductions: Some Random Stuff

## Lecture: 
Introduction to randomness in creative coding and its role in simulations. Discuss the difference between pure randomness and controlled randomness (Perlin noise).

## Book Reference: 
Chapter 1: Randomness

## JS/OOP Concepts:
Scope, Objects, Classes and static functions

## In-Class Exercise: 
- Simple sketch using perlin noise in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions

## Activity: 
- Create a class library for drawing shapes (fish, butterfly, spider)

## Supplemental Material:
- Introduction to Randomness in Creative Coding (video)
- Random Walks and Perlin Noise (video)
- Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings (art reference)
- Casey Reas' Generative Art (art reference)

## Homework: 
Build a sketch manipulating multiple properties with randomness.
